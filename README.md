<h1>This is a Web System about Automatic buying and selling system built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. And an AI has been developed</h1>
<br>
We here used HTML5, CSS3, BootStrap, Tailwind and JavaScript.
<br>
Here we use four types of Artificial Intelligence agents: Reactive, Cognitive, Environmental, and Goal-Oriented agents. Initially, we enter the card details and define the amount we intend to spend on purchases. 
<br>
The AI then provides us with a suggested list of products that reach the spending limit according to the entered balance.
<br>
In the end, it generates a receipt with all the information of the automatic purchase.
